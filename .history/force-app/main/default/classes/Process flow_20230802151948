Question 3
How would you test and deploy this change. Given this deployment pipeline:
Dev > Integration > UAT > Staging > Production.

Once I'm satisfied and all my test classes have passed, 
I will deploy the code to the Integration environment. Create a pull request for review.
If the reviewer(s) are satisfied, the code will be deployed UAT to be further tested.
Once and if only if successful, it will be moved to the staging area in wait for its final destination, Production.
